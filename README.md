# JavaScript Calculator

This JavaScript Calculator can be viewed at https://codepen.io/derbergfex/full/XzvxOP/

This repository contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code files for 'Build a JavaScript Calculator', FreeCodeCamp's first advanced front-end web development project. 

This project was built mainly to develop JavaScript algorithim-scripting skills, and hence why the CSS and the HTML are very minimal. To edit or add features to the web app on CodePen, simply press the 'Fork' button on the top-right side of the page.
